# Fine-Tuning Falcon 7B for MidJourney Prompt Generation

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the Falcon 7B model to generate descriptive prompts for MidJourney. We utilize advanced techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and quantization to enhance model efficiency and scalability. The fine-tuning is performed in a Google Colab environment with T4 GPU support.

## Overview

In this project, the Falcon 7B model is adapted to generate creative and contextually accurate MidJourney prompts. The key components of the project include:

- Fine-tuning a pre-trained model using advanced techniques
- Preparing and tokenizing a dataset of MidJourney prompts
- Training the model with customized parameters
- Evaluating and generating prompts with the fine-tuned model

## Acknowledgements

This project was guided by AL Jason's tutorial on fine-tuning AI models, available on YouTube. His insights and instructions were invaluable for this implementation. You can view his guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zv369Ggfk&t=387s).
